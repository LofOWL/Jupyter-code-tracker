SGD can be seeing as an approximation of **gradient descent (GD)**. In GD you have to run through all the samples in your training set to do a single itaration. In SGD you use only a subset of training samples to do the update for a parameter in a particular iteration. The subset used in each iteration is called a batch or minibatch."]}, {"block": 177, "type": "code", "linesLength": 20, "startIndex": 410, "lines": [" if a.grad is not None:\n", "        if a.grad.volatile:\n", "            a.grad.data.zero_()\n", "            b.grad.data.zero_()    \n", "        else:\n", "            data = a.grad.data\n", "            a.grad = Variable(data.new().resize_as_(data).zero_())\n", "            data = b.grad.data\n", "            b.grad = Variable(data.new().resize_as_(data).zero_())\n", "    \n", "    # Computes the gradient of loss with respect to all Variables with requires_grad=True.\n", "    # After this call a.grad and b.grad will be Variables holding the gradient\n", "    # of the loss with respect to a and b respectively.\n", "    loss.backward()\n", "    \n", "    # Update a and b using gradient descent; a.data and b.data are Tensors,\n", "    # a.grad and b.grad are Variables and a.grad.data and b.grad.data are\n", "    # Tensors.\n", "    a.data -= learning_rate * a.grad.data\n", "    b.data -= learning_rate * b.grad.data"]}, {"block": 178, "type": "markdown", "linesLength": 1, "startIndex": 430, "lines": ["Now, instead of using the optimizer, we will do the optimization ourselves!"]}, {"block": 179, "type": "code", "linesLength": 48, "startIndex": 431, "lines": ["net2 = LogReg().cuda()\n", "loss_fn=nn.NLLLoss()\n", "learning_rate = 1e-3\n", "optimizer=optim.Adam(net2.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)\n", "\n", "for epoch in range(1):\n", "    losses=[]\n", "    dl = iter(md.trn_dl)\n", "    for t in range(len(dl)):\n", "        # Forward pass: compute predicted y by passing x to the model.\n", "        x, y = next(dl)\n", "        y_pred = net2.forward(Variable(x).cuda())\n", "\n", "        # Compute and print loss.\n", "        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, Variable(y).cuda())\n", "        losses.append(loss)\n", "\n", "        net2.l1_w.grad\n", "        net2.l1_b.grad\n", "        \n", "        # Before the backward pass, use the optimizer object to zero all of the\n", "        # gradients for the variables it will update (which are the learnable weights\n", "        # of the model)\n", "#         if a.grad is not None:\n", "        if a.grad.volatile:\n", "            a.grad.data.zero_()\n", "            b.grad.data.zero_()    \n", "        else:\n", "            data = a.grad.data\n", "            a.grad = Variable(data.new().resize_as_(data).zero_())\n", "            data = b.grad.data\n", "            b.grad = Variable(data.new().resize_as_(data).zero_())\n", "    \n", "\n", "        # Backward pass: compute gradient of the loss with respect to model\n", "        # parameters\n", "        loss.backward()\n", "        # print(loss.data)\n", "\n", "        # Calling the step function on an Optimizer makes an update to its\n", "        # parameters\n", "        optimizer.step()\n", "        \n", "        \n", "    \n", "    val_dl = iter(md.val_dl)\n", "    val_scores = [score(*next(val_dl)) for i in range(len(val_dl))]\n", "    print(np.mean(val_scores))"]}]
