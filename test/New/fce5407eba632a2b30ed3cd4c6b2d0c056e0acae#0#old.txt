Analysis is mostly concerned with looking at past data, and prediction is using the past data to make estimates for the future. This notebook will document some of the basic capabilities of Stocker for prediction. I must recommend against any investing in the stock market, with or without Stocker! Mostly I made this tool because I wanted to get some experience with time series analysis and object-oriented programming. To see the code for Stocker, check out stocker.py and to see usage for analysis, look at the Stocker Analysis Usage notebook.
