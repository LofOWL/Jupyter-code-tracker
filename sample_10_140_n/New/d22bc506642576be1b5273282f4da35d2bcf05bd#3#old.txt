The main idea of the article is to use a [RNN](http://www.pnas.org/content/79/8/2554) with dropout everywhere, but in an intelligent way. There is a difference with the usual dropout, which is why you\u2019ll see a [`RNNDropout`](/text.models.html#RNNDropout) module: we zero things, as is usual in dropout, but we always zero the same thing according to the sequence dimension (which is the first dimension in pytorch). This ensures consistency when updating the hidden state through the whole sentences/articles. \n", "\n", "This being given, there are five different dropouts in the AWD-LSTM:\n", "- the first one, embedding dropout, is applied when we look the ids of our tokens inside the embedding matrix (to transform them from numbers to a vector of float). We zero some lines of it, so random ids are sent to a vector of zeros instead of being sent to their embedding vector.\n", "- the second one, input dropout, is applied to the result of the embedding with dropout. We forget random pieces of the embedding matrix (but as stated in the last paragraph, the same ones in the sequence dimension).\n", "- the third one is the weight dropout. It\u2019s the trickiest to implement as we randomly replace by 0s some weights of the hidden-to-hidden matrix inside the RNN: this needs to be done in a way that ensure the gradients are still computed and the initial weights still updated.\n", "- the fourth one is the hidden dropout. It\u2019s applied to the output of one of the layers of the RNN before it\u2019s used as input of the next layer (again same coordinates are zeroed in the sequence dimension).
